Aesthetic hobby coding for the hobby project of hobby projects. 

 


# outline

Should provide __usable__ colour palettes for the major Imperial and (```Emperor``` preserve us) Xenos factions, as well as (unspeakable heresy) the original ~twenty~ eighteen Legia . That's a lot of palettes requiring manual curation, but crucially also a lot of crap palettes only good for 4-6 levels at best. 


  * Must reformat to be ```less heretical```, more in line with sanctioned style guidelines
  * need to pick heretical images of ```His``` foes, many of which not cleared to know 
  * lovely code for this :: [ought to review ```r::wesandersonpalettes``` code](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson)
  * [need to reference ```r::cuttlefish``` material](https://github.com/jcbain/cuttlefish/)
  * ought to copy in the citadel HTML codes as presented elsewhere in data
  * ought to provide ```Thought For The Day``` lest become weak, prone to temptation, [heretical](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Thought_for_the_day)
  * all errors should decry ```HERESY``` before anything even remotely useful.
